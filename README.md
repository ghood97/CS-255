DriverPass was a driving education company that provided additional driving training to those looking to get a drivers license. They wanted to design a system that would allow their customers to view online instructional videos as well as book appointments for in-person driving lessons. I think I did a particularly good job with the diagrams in teh design template. I think my activity diagrams were very detailed and accurate. f I could choose one part of the project to revise, it would eb the hardware requirements. I would take a longer look at the specific types of hardware that were required to run this application. interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my system design by creating functional and non functional requirements to guide me in designing the system. In the end, it is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the ones who will be using the system. When I design software, I usually start with user stories and use cases in order to get a high level idea of what the project requires. Once all of the user's requirements are met, I then start to think about architecture and how to actually implement the system.
